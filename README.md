# Metrics

## Mean Absolute Error
- if the MAE is 0, the model is perfect, which in almost impossible

## Residual Sum of Squares
- the lower the RSS, the better the model's estimations

## Root Mean Square Error
- when the RMSE is low, it means that the error made by the model has a 
  small deviation from the true values

## Coefficient of Determination/R-Squared
- this is used to determine the goodness of fit of the model. Mostly, the higher
  value the better the model but this is not necessarily always true
